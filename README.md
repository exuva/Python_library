Download python and basics library

We need to use a python program (see MAIN.PY)
On this bat program, we need to know if you have already python or not. 
Some

First check if the user have already Python on hes C: disk anywhere at any version. 
If yes you will see on the console the current python version and his path
if python has not been founded, it will check if the user has access to internet, 
if not print "you don't have any internet connexion..." (shame)
if yes ask to the user if he want to install it, or update it to the lastest version (check the last version of python) at any choice the lastest version of python will be chosen.
After this you will download the Python version, the IT Security Policy (Business Justification Required) will ask you to install Python, you can see that it has been install from the original Program Publisher (Python Software Foundation).
You have to check The fonctionality is not provided by software in Software Center (CHECK ON THE SOFTWARE CENTER BEFORE CONTINUE) on the dropdown menu
Then enter you password, and click OK
The installation of Python is now ok. (congrats)

After this it'll install modules that's mainly required while doing what we are doing.
(Pandas, shutil, numpy, etc)

After this it will run the Python program...
